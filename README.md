  ## Description
  SVG Logo Maker is an app using node.js that will prompt the user with questions to design a simple logo. The user will be able to choose between three shapes (Circle, Square, and Triagle), text, and colors for both text and the shape. Once the user has finished answering the questions, a logo.svg file of the logo will be created in the 'examples' folder.
